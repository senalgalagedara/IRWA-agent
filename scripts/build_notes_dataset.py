"""Generator for the labelled shift-note NLP datasets
(`data/eval/notes_train.jsonl`, `data/eval/notes_test.jsonl`) used by
Task 16's NLP/IR evaluation.

Notes are assembled from a bank of hand-written sentence *templates* (full
sentences/fragments with `{ENTITY}` placeholders) plus vocabulary mentions
drawn from `app.seed.vocabulary`. Each label/split combination has at least
`MIN_TEMPLATES_PER_LABEL_SPLIT` (20) genuinely distinct templates —
different sentence structures, lengths, and entity counts (0-3), not the
same skeleton with only entity *values* swapped — and no single template is
used more than `MAX_USES_PER_TEMPLATE` (3) times within a split. Entity
character offsets are computed programmatically as the text is assembled
(`render_template`), never guessed by hand, so `text[start:end] ==
entity_text` holds by construction.

Train and test use **disjoint** template banks with different phrasing
conventions. A fixed random seed (`RANDOM_SEED`) makes generation
reproducible. Every generated test note's token-set Jaccard similarity is
checked against every already-generated train note during generation itself
(not as a post-hoc pass) and a candidate that is too similar is discarded
and re-drawn, so the committed test set never contains a near-duplicate of
a train note (see `scripts/validate_datasets.py::JACCARD_MAX`).

Run with: `python3 scripts/build_notes_dataset.py` (paths are resolved from
this file's location, so it works regardless of the invoking cwd).

    Templates are drawn by **shuffle-and-cycle**, not independent random
    sampling: each label's template bank is shuffled once (seeded, so this
    stays deterministic) and then walked in that fixed order, wrapping
    around when exhausted. This guarantees every template in the bank is
    used at least once before any template is repeated — plain
    with-replacement sampling (`rng.choice` every draw) can, and did,
    leave several templates completely unused by chance even with a
    per-template cap, understating real sentence-frame diversity. No
    template is used more than `MAX_USES_PER_TEMPLATE` times regardless.

    If `against_token_sets` is given (the token sets of an already-
    generated opposite split), any candidate note whose Jaccard similarity
    to any of them is >= `JACCARD_MAX` is discarded and generation moves on
    to the next template in the cycle — this is how train/test separation
    is enforced, as part of generation rather than as a post-hoc patch.
