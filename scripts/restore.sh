# Restore + verify a backup made by scripts/backup.sh (task-25-brief.md req. 8).
#
# Usage: scripts/restore.sh <backup-file.tar.enc>
#
# Always restores into the database `linesense_restore` (dropped and
# recreated by this script) and a separate document directory under
# .local/restore-documents/<timestamp> -- never into linesense_dev or any
# other target, so a mistaken run can never clobber real data.
#
# Verification (fails the script, non-zero exit, on any mismatch):
#   1. every table's restored row count equals the manifest recorded at
#      backup time;
#   2. every ACTIVE/SUPERSEDED document_versions.storage_key exists as a
#      file under the restored document directory;
#   3. every material_balances.on_hand_accepted equals the sum of its
#      material's ACCEPTED-lot stock_movements (backend-contracts.md
#      section 2's material_balances invariant).
