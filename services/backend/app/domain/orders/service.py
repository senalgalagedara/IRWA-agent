"""Order commands and queries: list/create/detail, lifecycle transitions,
production progress, and shipment eligibility.

Database access lives here (unlike the pure `app.domain.orders.lifecycle`
and `app.domain.quality.calc` modules); every write happens inside the
caller's transaction (the `get_db_session` FastAPI dependency commits or
rolls back around the route handler).

Concurrency: every command that mutates an order locks the order row
(``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``) *before* comparing ``expected_version`` or
touching anything else, closing the race between the scope check (a plain
read) and the write. Cancelling an order then releases its active
allocations and reservations through the shared, row-locking helpers of
`app.domain.capacity.service` and `app.domain.inventory.service` (lock
order: order -> slots -> balances). Recomputing *other* orders'
`material_state` after a release would need to lock those orders too,
which would happen after the balance lock above and so could violate that
same lock order; instead, cancellation enqueues a `maintenance` job
(`app.jobs.handlers.handle_refresh_material_states`) that recomputes them
in its own, later transaction.
