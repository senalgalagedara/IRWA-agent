# docs/development-guide.md resolves to a file that actually exists on disk. Absolute URLs
# (http/https), mailto: links, and pure in-page fragments (#heading) are

# Usage: scripts/check-doc-links.sh [root-dir]
#   root-dir defaults to the repository root (the parent of this script's
#   directory). A root-dir argument is accepted so this script can be
#   exercised against a throwaway fixture tree in tests.
