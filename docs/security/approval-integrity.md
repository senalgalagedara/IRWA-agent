# Approval integrity

How LineSense AI keeps an agent proposal from becoming an unreviewed,
stale or self-approved change. Implementation: `app/domain/approvals/service.py`
(rules and transaction), `app/api/recommendations.py` (routes, retry,
idempotency). Error codes and the audit contract: `docs/architecture/backend-contracts.md` §5.

## The model

A recommendation is a **proposal**, never a change. It records what would
happen (`proposal`), a hash of exactly that (`proposal_hash`), and the
version of every input it was derived from (`input_versions`: the order,
each capacity slot, each material balance). Nothing in the proposal path
writes to `allocations`, `reservations`, `line_capacity_slots` or
`material_balances`.

Two separate acts follow, by two separate people:

1. `POST /api/v1/recommendations/{id}/decision` — a supervisor records
   `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`. **Approving does not apply anything.**
2. `POST /api/v1/recommendations/{id}/apply` — a supervisor who is *not*
   the proposer applies it, inside one transaction.

## Separation of duties

- `recommendation:decide` and `recommendation:apply` are supervisor-only
  (`app/auth/policy.py`). A caller with no role in the recommendation's
  factory gets 404 (existence is never revealed); a caller with a role but
  without the permission gets 403 `FORBIDDEN`.
- The **proposer** — `recommendations.proposer_user_id`, i.e. whoever
  requested the analysis run — may neither decide nor apply the proposal:
  403 `SELF_APPROVAL_DENIED`, recorded as an audit event with outcome
  `DENIED` in its own committed transaction. A second supervisor of the
  same factory may do both; only the proposer is excluded.
- Every successful decision and application writes `recommendation.decided`
  / `recommendation.applied` audit events with before/after summaries.

## Lock order

Shared with `app.domain.capacity.service` and `app.domain.inventory.service`:

```
order row  ->  recommendation row  ->  line_capacity_slots  ->  material_balances
                                        (ascending id)          (ascending id)
```

`apply` locks the **union** of everything the transaction may touch before
it touches anything:

- slots: every slot in the proposal **plus** every slot the order has ever
  been allocated to (the set `release_order_allocations` locks);
- balances: the balance of every proposed material **plus** the order's BOM
  materials and every material it has ever reserved (the set
  `release_order_reservations` locks). A proposed material without a balance
  row gets one (`ensure_balance`) *before* the lock sweep, so
  `reserve_material` can never create and lock a row out of order.

Because the union is locked up front and by sorted id, the release/allocate/
reserve helpers never need a lock the transaction does not already hold, and
two concurrent applies can never take the same two rows in opposite orders.

ACTIVE `allocations`/`reservations` rows are re-read `FOR UPDATE` after the
slot/balance locks (inside those helpers), so a release that another
transaction committed first is never applied twice.

## Freshness

`check_staleness` compares `input_versions` with the current `version` of
every referenced order, slot and balance, and **fails closed**:

- a row that no longer exists is stale (`current_version = null`);
- a row the proposal would actually write to — the order, every
  `proposal.allocations[].slot_id`, every `proposal.reservations[].balance_id` —
  that `input_versions` does not pin is stale too (`expected_version = null`).
  "Does not pin" covers a missing section entry, a key that is not a UUID and a
  version that is not an integer: none of them prove the row has not moved.
- versions recorded for rows the proposal does not touch are still checked.

- In the **detail view** it is advisory: `stale`, `stale_inputs` and
  `apply_blocked_reason: "STALE"` tell the reviewer before they act.
- In **apply** it is authoritative: it runs *after* the row locks, inside
  the transaction that would otherwise write. Any drift:
  1. sets the recommendation to `SUPERSEDED` with
     `superseded_reason = "STALE_INPUT: <kinds>"`,
  2. audits `recommendation.applied` with outcome `FAILED`,
  3. notifies the proposer ("Inputs changed — run a new analysis"),
  4. **commits that status change**, and only then
  5. fails the request with 409 `STALE_INPUT`, listing each changed input in
     `field_errors`.

  The idempotency claim is released on this path (`app.idempotency.service.release`)
  so the key is not burned on a rejection.

An approval can therefore never bypass a fresh analysis: reference fixture 6
(`docs/architecture/formulas.md`) is exactly this case — an approved proposal
whose material balance moved on is refused, not applied.

Expiry works the same way: past `expires_at`, the recommendation becomes
`EXPIRED` (committed, audited, proposer notified) and the request fails with
409 `EXPIRED`.

The `proposal_hash` is checked on both decide and apply: a proposal whose
content changed since the reviewer read it yields 409 `CONFLICT`
("Proposal changed").

## The apply transaction

Under the locks, and only when nothing is stale:

1. the order must be `VALIDATED` or `PLANNED` (else 409 `INVALID_TRANSITION`);
2. the order's existing ACTIVE allocations and reservations are released
   (slot minutes and balance `reserved` decremented, versions bumped);
3. each proposed allocation goes through `capacity.allocate`, which
   re-validates remaining capacity under the slot lock — a failure rolls the
   **whole** transaction back (409 `CONFLICT`, zero partial rows);
4. each proposed reservation goes through `inventory.reserve_material`, which
   re-validates `on_hand - reserved` under the balance lock — same rollback;
5. the order becomes `PLANNED`, its `material_state` is recomputed
   (`recompute_material_states`, restricted to this order — the only order
   row this transaction holds), and its version is bumped;
6. the recommendation becomes `APPLIED` with `applied_by` / `applied_at`;
7. a `maintenance.refresh_material_states` job (deduped per order +
   recommendation) recomputes *other* orders that share the materials, in
   its own later transaction — locking them here would mean taking an order
   lock after a balance lock.

**Idempotency**: `Idempotency-Key` is required. A retry with the same key
replays the stored 200 body and creates nothing; a different key against an
already `APPLIED` recommendation gets 409 `CONFLICT`.

**Bounded retry**: the route owns its session and retries the whole
transaction up to 3 times, with jittered backoff, on SQLSTATE `40001`
(serialization failure) and `40P01` (deadlock detected) only. Everything
else propagates.
